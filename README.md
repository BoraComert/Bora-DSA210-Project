# Bora-DSA210-Project

## Objective

Istanbul is one of the most touristic cities in the world. In this project i will be analyzing the effects of the weather conditions on the number of foreign visitors in Istanbul. 
My goal is to understand how weather patterns such as precipitation ,temperature and wind speed interact with foreign visitor numbers and if there is a correlation exists.

Additionally i will explore the role of climate in the visitor's home countries. By analyzing whether tourists from warmer regions prefer visiting Istanbul in cooler months, or if those from colder regions are more likely to visit during summer, this study will provide deeper insights into seasonal variations in tourism.
