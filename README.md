# Bora-DSA210-Project

## Objective

Istanbul is one of the most touristic cities in the world. In this project i will be analyzing the effects of the weather conditions on the number of foreign visitors in Istanbul. 
My goal is to understand how weather patterns such as precipitation ,temperature and wind speed interact with foreign visitor numbers and if there is a correlation exists.

## Data

**Weather Data**

- Precipitation 
- Maximum temperature
- Minimum temperature
- Average Humidity

**Foreign Visitor Data**

- Place
- Monthly Foreign Visitor Number

## Plan

Since the weather data contains daily information, my first step will be to make averages from those inputs.
I will collect the averages of minimum and maximum temperatures to have a genuine opinion on temperature.
