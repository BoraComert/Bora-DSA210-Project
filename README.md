# Bora-DSA210-Project

Istanbul is one of the most touristic cities in the world. In this project i will be analyzing the effects of weather conditions on the number of foreign visitors in istanbul. 
My goal is to understand how weather patterns such as precipitation ,temperature and wind speeds and total foreign visitor numbers interact with each other and if a correlation
exists.
