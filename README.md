# Bora-DSA210-Project

## Objective

Istanbul is one of the most touristic cities in the world. In this project i will be analyzing the effects of the weather conditions on the number of foreign visitors in Istanbul. 
My goal is to understand how weather patterns such as precipitation ,temperature and wind speed interact with foreign visitor numbers and if there is a correlation exists.

- Place(Turkey or Istanbul)
- Monthly Foreign Visitor Number



## Data Analysis Plan

1. - Since the weather data have been recorded daily, i will compute daily averages for key weather elements to align with the foreign visitor dataset which has been recorded monthly.

2. - Minimum and maximum temperatures will be averaged to obtain a temperature value.
